In the process of learning React with Redux.  

This repository is the code as I build out my first project in the training course I'm taking on Udemy.com.


There are two methods for getting started with this repo.

This contains the node packages that are used to install react libraries, webpack, redux and babel so I can use ES6 and react's own JSX to code a project that will tap into Youtube's API and return videos upon a user search.

once the repository is downloaded, use "npm start" from command line and open a browser on localhost: 8080 to see page.
